== About
I am an assistant professor of computer science 
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL The College of William and Mary (W&M)] [http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/college-of-william-and-mary-231624/overall-rankings (US News Rankings)] in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I am leading /*Insight Computer Architecture Lab*/ with the goal to generate insights that would enable
more energy-efficient, reliable, secure, capable, and useful computing systems \n

/I am currently teaching: [http://adwaitjog.github.io/teach/parallel_com_arch_cs680_s17.html CSCI 680: Parallel Computer Architecture]/

== Recent News
- Received NSF CRII Award 2017 (sole PI). Thanks NSF!
- I am serving on the External Review Committee of [https://www.microarch.org/micro50/ MICRO 2017] 
- Papers accepted in HPCA 2017 and VLSID 2017
- Papers accepted in IISWC, PACT (2), MICRO, and SIGMETRICS 2016.  
- Invited to serve on the Program Committees of [http://dsn2017.github.io/ DSN 2017], [http://www.hpdc.org/2017/ HPDC 2017], [http://gpgpu10.athoura.com/ GPGPU 2017], and [http://www.nas-conference.org/NAS-2017/ NAS 2017]. Submit your best work.
- *\<span style=\"color: red\"\>Looking for self-motivated students to join my research group. Multiple 
funded positions are available. If you are interested in doing research in the area of computer 
architecture, please email me with your CV. \<\/span\>*I am especially looking for students who are 
interested in the areas of GPU computing, 
memory systems, and emerging/non-traditional computing hardware architectures. Students interested in other 
disciplines such as (but not limited to) biology, economics, machine learning, physics, security, are also welcome to initiate a discussion with me to explore cross-disciplinary research opportunities.
