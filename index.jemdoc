== Insight Computer Architecture Lab @ William and Mary 
The high-level goal of the lab is to generate novel insights, which would faciliate
in building future computing systems more energy-efficient, reliable, secure, capable, 
and useful.

The lab is looking for self-motivated students. *Multiple 
funded positions are available*. If you are interested in doing research in the general 
area of computer architecture, please email [http://adwaitjog.github.io/ Prof. Adwait Jog] 
with your CV. 
We are especially looking for students who are interested in the areas of GPU computing, 
memory systems, and emerging/non-traditional computing hardware (e.g., quantum and DNA) 
architectures. Students interested in other disciplines such as (but not limited to) 
biology, economics, machine learning, physics, security, are also welcome to apply.
