<h2>Keynote 1</h2>
<p><b>Speaker: Lizy Kurian John (UT Austin)</b></p>
<p><b>Title:</b> Compute in-situ and in-transit     </p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Moving data consumes time and energy. Computation can potentially be made more efficient by computing where the data is located (Computing In Situ) however there are several challenges in determining which pieces of data should stay where, and what kinds of compute can be integrated with various memory and cache layers.  Some data movement is still essential and computation can also be accelerated by computing while data is being moved (Computing in Transit). This talk presents (i) various in-situ computing capabilities that will comprise both processing in or near main memory as well as computing within on-chip caches and memory close to the cores;  (ii) novel in-transit compute capabilities that will enable cutting down on and in many cases completely eliminating unnecessary roundtrip data transfers by processing of data transparently as it is transferred between main memory and local compute cores or across the cache hierarchies.</p>

<h2>Keynote 2</h2>
<p><b>Speaker: Yan Solihin (NSF/NCSU)</b></p>
<p><b>Title:</b> When Moving Data is Expensive: What We can Learn from High Gas Prices    </p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
Processor needs data to be transported from memory in order to compute. Due to various trends in server architectures, some data will be located quite far away from the processor. In this talk, I will discuss strategies that can be deployed to reduce the cost of data transportation. Analogies can be found from the 2006-2008 time period when gas prices were high in the US, making people transportation expensive. Lessons from high gas prices can be applied to deal with expensive data transportation. </p>

<h2>Keynote 3</h2>
<p><b>Speaker: Jun Yang, UPitt</b></p>
<p><b>Title:</b> Toward a More Efficient and Manageable GPGPU Design     </p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Todayâ€™s applications are increasingly compute-intensive and data-intensive at the same time. Computer systems are challenged by the requirement of high processing capability and data handling capability. One of the most critical issues is the frequent and large volume of data movement across system stack. Excessive data movements hog system performance and consume extra energy unnecessarily. It is therefore crucial to combat this challenge and minimize its impact on performance and energy. In this talk, mitigating the impact of data movement is discussed in the context of GPGPU, a general purpose parallel accelerator. An effective mechanism to mask the influence of data movement is to utilize the parallel feature of the architecture and overlap it with computing so that delay caused by moving data around is hidden behind computing cycles. In the effort of reducing the volume of data movement, and hence reducing energy consumption, the observation of redundant data removal is the key to architecture innovations. We introduce new architecture features that not only lessen the data movement overhead but also enable better manageability of the accelerator resources.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of achieving exascale performance under stringent power budget is important, exciting, and challenging. One of the biggest impediments in achieving this goal is the excessive data movement across different levels of the memory hierarchy.  In this workshop, we intend to discuss innovative ways to reduce this data movement in a variety of architectures (including CPUs, GPUs, handhelds, data centers, IoT, accelerators etc.). We welcome all novel submissions that describe hardware, software, or hardware-software co-design techniques to reduce the data movement. </p>
